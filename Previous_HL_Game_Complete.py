# Higher / Lower version 2
# Author: Iszac Jarvis
# Date: 26/09/2019

# v1: Basic program works but it does not loop yet.
# v2: Program loops and uses a random number (instead of 48)
# v3: Shows number of guesses left,
# has special message if user guesses correctly on the first time
# v4: Checks numbers are valid <uses a function which is beyond L1...
# v5: Allows user to choose number of rounds (maximum 5)
# v6: Does not allow duplicate guesses anymore.
# v7: Removed 'secret number' answer. We are done!
